EX6 question:
Currently, every time we send an SMS we also show notification "sending sms: .....".
What should we add in our code-base so that when the SMS will get delivered, this notification's text will be changed to "sms sent: ......"?

answer:
we need to add another action to our broadcastReceiver, that, given a notificationID (in the param, storage in an intent), will change the notification message.
